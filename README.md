# Introduction

**profile-gen** is a simple, lightweight tool designed to streamline the process of creating resumes and portfolios.
By using a single, centralized JSON format, you can generate professional resumes and portfolios in multiple formats (PDF, Word, etc.) with ease.

Keeping track of multiple resumes and portfolios for different job applications can be cumbersome, especially when they contain similar information.
**profile-gen** eliminates this hassle by allowing you to maintain one consistent profile in a semi-structured JSON format.

Whenever you need to update your skills, experience, or any other detail, simply modify your JSON profile. The tool will automatically generate updated versions of your resume and portfolio, saving you time and ensuring consistency across all formats.

Whether you're a job seeker, freelancer, or professional with various roles, profile-gen makes it easy to maintain and update all of your resumes and portfolios without duplicating effort.
